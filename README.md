# ESP modules in OpenSCAD

This OpenSCAD library contains models of a range of common ESP-based boards.

The models include helper functions to place things at the correct positions of the mounting holes, usb connector, buttons, etc. to make it easier to build OpenSCAD projects around these boards.

The library was originally made by [DonJuanito and published on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1933779).

Modified by Mads Kjeldgaard 2023 to include more boards.

The file "ESPModels.scad" is meant to be used as a library (using `use <ESPModels.scad>`). If it's opened by itself, all modules will be displayed.
